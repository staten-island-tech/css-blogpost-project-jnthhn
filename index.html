        so there’s this really cute girl i’ve been talking to from high school,
        and things were going good, but i might’ve messed up. i called her
        "dude" in a text the other day, and now i’m stressing if i put myself in
        the friend zone. she’s been cool about it, but idk... should i just go
        for it or play it cool a bit longer?

        there’s this cute guy i’ve been talking to from high school, and things were going good, but i think i messed up. i got nervous and said something super awkward when we were texting, and now i can’t tell if he’s still into me or not. should i just go for it and see what happens or give him some space?</div>
